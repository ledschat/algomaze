# The Algorithmic maze

The *Algorithmic maze* is a computer science installation exposed at [**Le Palais de la DÃ©couverte**](http://www.palais-decouverte.fr), Paris. 
Its aims at introduce algorithms to relsolve mazes. Three robots are displayed on the maze, and the visitor can control them using different methods, with touchscreens and push buttons. 

## How to compile and test

The recommended way to compile the code is to use [**cmake**](https://cmake.org/), which automatically generates project files for your favourite IDE or build system:
```
git clone https://github.com/ledschat/algomaze
cd algomaze/binary
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

To test the application you need the **Led's Chat Link** program. You can download it from [**here**](https://store.leds-chat.com).
